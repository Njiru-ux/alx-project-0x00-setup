# alx-project-0x00-setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Scaffolding a Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a Next.js application using CLI tools and best practices for modern web development.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js application created using `create-next-app` with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration. The project serves as a foundation for building modern React applications with type safety and utility-first CSS styling.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
